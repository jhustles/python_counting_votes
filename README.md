# Counting Election Votes To Determine Results Using Python

![Vote-Counting](resources/counting_votes.jpg)

## Project Scope:
* Modernize small, rural town vote-counting process using Python. (Up until now, the city has been trustfully tallying them one-by-one...)

### Prerequisites

* Python 3

## Getting Started

* The poll data is called [election_data.csv](resources/election_data.csv).

* The dataset is composed of three columns: `Voter ID`, `County`, and `Candidate`.

* I created a Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following:
* 
  * The total number of votes cast

  * A complete list of candidates who received votes

  * The percentage of votes each candidate won

  * The total number of votes each candidate won

  * The winner of the election based on popular vote.

## Running the file:
* Run the main.py file in CMD Windows / Terminal (MAC)
